## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Mario GutiÃ©rrez. Through my life I have had interest in learning a lot of different stuff, from martial arts to photography, from djing to different languages. But all of them have one thing in common: they are a way of expressing myself. And, in regards to coding, it is no different! No matter what I do, I will always search for a way of expressing myself and leaving a mark in everything I do, wether it is personal or work related.
